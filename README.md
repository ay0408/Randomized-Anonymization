# Randomized-Anonymization

We proposed privacy-preserving methods for data sharing that satisfy both k-anonymity and ε-differential privacy.

The proposed methods are
k-RR (k-anonymization → randomized response), RR-k (randomized response → k-anonymization), and (ε,k)-Randomized Anonymization.

For details of our mechanisms, please see our paper entitled "(ε, k)-Randomized Anonymization: ε-Differentially Private Data Sharing with k-Anonymity". (to appear at HEALTHINF 2023)
