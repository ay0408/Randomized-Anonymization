# Randomized-Anonymization

We proposed privacy-preserving methods for data sharing that satisfy both k-anonymity and ε-differential privacy.

The proposed methods are
k-RR (k-anonymization → randomized response), RR-k (randomized response → k-anonymization), and (ε, k)-Randomized Anonymization.

## Important future problems

・Developing k-anonymization methods more suited for integration with Randomized Response.

・How should we determine appropriate values of ε and k for each medical information?

## Note

For details of our mechanisms, please see our paper entitled "(ε, k)-Randomized Anonymization: ε-Differentially Private Data Sharing with k-Anonymity" (https://doi.org/10.5220/0011665600003414) presented at HEALTHINF 2023.

Errata:

・p.289. 3.2.1
  "When the following inequality holds: ε ≥" → "When the following inequality holds: e^ε ≥"
